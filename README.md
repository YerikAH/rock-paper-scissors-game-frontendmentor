## What I learned
Another app developed with React, it was a bit easy to develop with useState, so I developed it with the useReducer hook, although I don't think it was necessary, I just used it to learn its usage, I also used styled components, but I decided to create a single file where I put all the styles of styled-component. `components/Styles.jsx`. On the other hand, use the concept of React portals for the rules part.
## Technologies used in the project
